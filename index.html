      <p>The Mars Rover Simulator (Doesn't actually have a name yet) is a project started on February 23, 2019, and is continuously being updated, possibly right now! The program is hosted <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/BluscaInk-STEM/present/Pdv2MjJ8W">here</a>, and you can help make it better by suggesting things such as bugs, errors, ideas, or even comments about ideas that are in the program itself! Do this by going to Google Forms and filling out <a href="#">this form</a> (not yet linked)!</p>
      <p>Okay, so maybe that wasn't very descriptive about the program itself, and what it teaches. So this is what that is all about.</p>
      <p>The program is about a rover on Mars that has to move around and complete tasks like pick up a rock, or take a picture. To do this, you can use the command line. It is the gray bar with an arrow pointing to the right at the bottom. Click on it to make the cursor blink, and you can now type commands. There are several commands, but you can go <a href="#">here</a> to find out every single spec of the program (not yet linked). It can also be paused by clicking on the scene and pressing space. This enables you to see everything the rover sees.</p>
